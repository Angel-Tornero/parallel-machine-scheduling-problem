# Parallel Machine Scheduling Solver - C++ (University Project)

## 📝 Description

This C++ program solves a variant of the parallel machine scheduling problem. It implements multiple heuristic and metaheuristic approaches to find efficient task distributions across multiple machines.

The project was developed as part of a university assignment in 2021 and includes implementations of Greedy, GRASP, and GVNS algorithms, along with basic benchmarking.

### 🔧 How to Run

```bash
$ ./main [problem file] [k value] [limit iterations]
```

- The problem files are stored in the `problems/` directory.  
- `k value` is an integer for GRASP (should be less than the number of tasks).  
- `limit iterations` defines how many iterations the algorithms will run.
